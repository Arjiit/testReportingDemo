# Visualizing data from mongo

This is a short project to experiment different visulaization libraries. To start with, I've used D3.js - a javascript library for manipulating documents based on data.
For demonstration, I am using test data stored in MongoDB for visualization. However, this source can be any other data input including data from csv, tsv etc.

AngularJS on the client side. NodeJS and Express running on the server and mongoDB as database. Connecting from Node to database is using the mongoose module.

Clone the project.

Inside the project- Run npm install.

Setup MongoDB - Insert demo data by running 'node datainit.js' present in /testReportingDemo/frameworks2015/app/src/server/datainit.js

Visualize the data using D3.
